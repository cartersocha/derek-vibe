```

## What's Working

✅ **Build Status**: `npm run build` completes successfully
✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors
✅ **ESLint**: Only minor warnings (fixed)
✅ **Authentication**: Login/logout flow implemented
✅ **CRUD Operations**: All create, read, update, delete operations
✅ **Relationships**: Campaigns ↔ Sessions ↔ Characters
✅ **Validation**: Form validation with Zod
✅ **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layouts

## What Still Needs Manual Setup

You need to complete these steps to run the application:

### 1. Supabase Project Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Get API credentials
- [ ] Run database migration SQL
- [ ] (Optional) Create storage buckets for images

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Fill in `.env.local` with:
  - Supabase URL and keys
  - APP_PASSWORD (your choice)
  - SESSION_SECRET (generate random string)

### 3. First Run
```bash
npm install         # Dependencies already installed
npm run dev         # Start development server
```

**See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions!**

## What's NOT Included (Per Spec - Phase 2+)

These features were marked as optional/future enhancements:

❌ Image upload functionality (infrastructure ready in storage.ts)
❌ Rich text editor for notes (using textarea currently)
❌ Dark mode
❌ Search and filtering
❌ Image optimization
❌ Realtime updates
❌ Export functionality
❌ Drag and drop

These can be added later as enhancements.

## Testing Checklist

Once you have Supabase configured, test these flows:

- [ ] Login with password
- [ ] Create a campaign
- [ ] Create multiple characters
- [ ] Create a session and link characters
- [ ] Edit a campaign
- [ ] Edit a character
- [ ] Edit a session and change linked characters
- [ ] View dashboard statistics
- [ ] Delete a session (characters should remain)
- [ ] Delete a campaign (sessions should cascade delete)
- [ ] Logout and verify redirect to login

## Performance

Build output shows excellent performance:
- First Load JS: ~105 kB for protected pages
- Static generation working
- Dynamic rendering for data-dependent pages
- Middleware: 38.2 kB

## Next Steps

1. Follow [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) to configure Supabase
2. Set up environment variables
3. Run the application
4. Test all functionality
5. (Optional) Deploy to Vercel or your preferred platform
