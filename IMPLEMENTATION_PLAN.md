---

## Recent Development History

> **Note (2025-10-17):** Completed a comprehensive mobile responsiveness pass that adds collapsible mobile navigation, stacks action bars on small screens, widens primary controls for better touch targets, and implements mobile-specific CSS optimizations.

> **Note (2025-10-18):** Implemented a performance-focused sidebar overhaul, session form draft auto-save with auto-resizing text areas, redirect-aware character creation, defaulted session dates, and refreshed character metadata presentation.

> **Note (2025-10-18, later):** Hardened text inputs with HTML sanitization, throttled interactive UI resizing, deferred character searches, and cleaned image preview URLs while expanding draft persistence safeguards.

> **Note (2025-10-18, evening):** Rolled out campaign-aware session numbering, five-across character grids, compact inline search on the characters tab, and sidebar refinements that double-click collapse and auto-limit width to content.

> **Note (2025-10-18, late night):** Unified session search and attendee chips across pages, expanded the dashboard's recent sessions feed with richer metadata, removed obsolete quick actions, and capped badge rendering for better mobile performance.

> **Note (2025-10-19):** Added caret-anchored session mention menus with inline character creation, reusable mention rendering helpers, and streamlined header image controls on the session edit form.

> **Note (2025-10-19, afternoon):** Introduced a global auto-capitalization provider that uppercases the first alphabetical character in text inputs while allowing opt-outs via a data attribute.

> **Note (2025-10-19, evening):** Synced character backstory mention menus with the session experience (inline creation, widened dropdown, caret anchoring), normalized saved session and character names to title case, and enabled spellcheck for long-form drafting fields.

> **Note (2025-10-20):** Consolidated session draft autosave timers into a shared idle-aware coordinator, pruning redundant timeouts ahead of the remaining mobile and performance follow-ups.

> **Note (2025-10-20, evening):** Color-coded mention hyperlinks and dropdown badges so character, session, and organization references stand out consistently while drafting or reading notes.

> **Note (2025-10-20, late night):** Refactored attendee chip rendering into a shared `SessionParticipantPills` component for consistent ordering and focus states across pages, and streamlined the dashboard's recent sessions by removing the note preview block.

> **Note (2025-10-21):** Landed campaign create/edit form refinements: editable created dates, a consistent two-by-two grid of date and entity selectors, and multi-selects that persist linked groups, sessions, and characters through Supabase. Added the `campaign_characters` migration with backfill to keep historic associations intact.

> **Note (2025-10-21, evening):** Hooked the application-level uniqueness guard (`assertUniqueValue`) into all entity actions to prevent case-insensitive duplicates and expanded mention tinting to include organizations alongside characters and sessions.

> **Note (2025-10-21, late):** Added campaign created date positioning to the top-right of campaign cards for improved visual hierarchy and quick date reference.
